Contribution Instructions
=========================

This project welcomes contributions. Contributions are managed through GitHub
pull requests.

# Issue guidelines

If you find an issue with any code in this project, feel free to open an issue.
Templates exist for bug reports and feature requests.

# Pull request guidelines

* Fork this repository.
* Create a branch off master, and make your commits in that branch.
* Test your changes locally before raising a pull request.

# Commit guidelines

* Isolate each commit to a single component/folder as far as possible
* Use a standard message template. I follow the template from [this
  link](https://codeinthehole.com/tips/a-useful-template-for-commit-messages/)
* Ensure that you have any necessary tests included to test your changes.

## Additional commit requirements

* Commits should have a `Signed-off-by` line. You can use `git commit -s` to
  automatically append this to your message.
* Any generated objects should be included in `.gitignore`.
* A commit should be self-contained, i.e., if I check out any commit in a clean
  workspace, I should be able to run `./.github/scripts/build-and-test.sh` and
  not encounter any failures.
* Any additional dependencies should be called out in `INSTALL.md`
